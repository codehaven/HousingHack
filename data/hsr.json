However, upon receiving the food we realised that neither was the case. Moreover, they did not even bother to give me the complete change (bill was INR 892.00 for 2 meals, one velloory fry which was served as netholi fry and a dragon chicken). They just paid me 100bucks saying 'it is just 8.00Rs Sir'. Well I do not know what class of customer do visit this restaurant...to me that is so damn greedy.
